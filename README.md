# Stellar transaction compiler

stc is a library and command-line tool that translates
[Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/) blockchain transactions back and
forth between human-readable
[txrep](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0011.md)
format and Stellar's native binary XDR representation.  With stc, you
can create, view, edit, sign, and submit Stellar transactions.

# Installing `stc` for non-developers

To install or upgrade this software if you don't plan to hack on it,
run the following two commands (assuming your GOPATH is in the default
location of `~/go`):

    rm -rf ~/go/src/github.com/xdrpp/stc/
    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/...

The `rm` command is necessary when upgrading because [some `go get`
limitation](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27526) leaves your
tree in a detached state, so that `go get -u` cannot pull from the
remote `go1` branch.

Once this completes, put the `~/go/bin` directory on your path and you
should be able to run `stc`.

To install the software from within a go module (a directory with a
`go.mod` file), you will need to specify the `go1` branch to get
autogenerated files.  Do so by running:

    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/...@go1


If you'd like to install just the [`goxdr`](cmd/goxdr) XDR compiler,
you can also run, depending on context, one of:

    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/cmd/goxdr

    go get github.com/xdrpp/stc/cmd/goxdr@go1

# Using `stc`

See the [stc(1)][stc.1] man page for the command-line tool.

See the [godoc documentation][gh-pages] for the library.  Because
`stc` contains auto-generated source files that are not on the master
branch in git, it is best to view the documentation locally, rather
than through on-line godoc viewers that will not show you the correct
branch.  To view godoc, after installing `stc` with `go get` as
described above, start a local godoc server and open it in your
browser as follows:

    godoc -index -http localhost:6060 &
    xdg-open http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/xdrpp/stc

On MacOS computers, run `open` instead of `xdg-open`, or just paste
the URL into your browser.

# Building `stc` for developers

Because `stc` requires autogenerated files, the `master` branch is not
meant to be compiled under `$GOPATH`, but rather in a standalone
directory with a `make`.

Furthermore, to build `stc` you also need to install `goyacc` and the
Go extra `crypto` library.  If you don't already have these installed,
or if your versions are too old, run the following command:

    make update-depend

to install the build-type dependencies under your `$GOPATH` (`~/go` by
default).  Once these dependencies are place, just run:

    make

to build the tool.  If that doesn't work, you may have an old version
of the extra `crypto` library, so make sure to run `make
update-depend`.

To install `stc`, you will also need [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to
format the man page.

To understand the included [`goxdr`](cmd/goxdr) XDR compiler, see the
[goxdr(1)][goxdr.1]).
